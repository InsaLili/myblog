title: After ITS'14 conference Dresden
---

<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>
	I spent five days in Dresden to attend to the ITS'14 conference as an attendee meanwhile as a student volunteer. This is the first time I attended an international conference. I gained a lot, from my PhD subject to the way I should do my research.

<p>
	Not to talk about our "awfully amazing SV group", only talk about the conference talks. People who presented in the conference are amazing. They did great works, they are motivited and enthusiatic. They have great devices and they are proud of their work. They work in groups, support for each other. Compare to myself, I found out that in the past year I worked so isolated. I just digged in my research field by myself, followed by my supervisors suggestions twice a month which are so limited.

<p>
	I realized that I need a internship, right now! Join in a lab where people collaborate together and speak english. 
</p>
<p>
	I sent two mails today, to two good universities in Switzerland, to ask for an internship. Now I am waiting for the reply. I really wish I could get the chance to do research in another place, to learn from people, to be inspired, to get new blood, to have some fresh air. I don't want to be "the only one" in our group as now.
</p>
<p>
	God bless me.
