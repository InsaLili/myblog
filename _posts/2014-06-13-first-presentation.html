title: My first presentation in lab

<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>
	Today I did my first english presentation in my lab.
</p>
<p>
 	I prepared it for a long time. And I thought that it was not bad.
</p>
<p>
	It is also the first time I used LaTex (beamer library) to do the presentation document. I have to say it was a bad choice, LaTex is not suitable for doing this. I prefer to use WYSIWYG tool.
</p>
<p>
	Another thing, today I found that TÃ©lecom ParicTech is recruiting a PhD candidate, and the subject they proposed is exactly as same as mine. It is such a good lab in the best university of France. 
</p>
<p>
	From this news, I could learn that at least my subject is worth to be done. And I also feel a little stress because when there is such a good lab doing the same research as yours. You need to do something remarkable to show your worth.
</p>
<p>
	OK, bon courage!
