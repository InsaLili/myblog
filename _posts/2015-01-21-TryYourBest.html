	I visited the top-tier lab last week, met a lot of smart people there. They are smart and nice, they made me realize the huge gap between myself and the world's top guys.

	Now I am waiting for the final result of my internship. Actually, if I can start the internship in March, it has already been fixed. Cause my supervisors suggested me to finish my own prototype firstly, the internship couldn't be started before June. In that case, I have to negociate with people there to see if the beginning date is approprate for them.

<p>
	Anyway, I have already tried my best. The only thing I can do now is waiting. Even if I can't get it, nothing to lose, right?

	我知道自己很弱。。在国内时的优越感早在走出国门后消失殆尽。见过了那么多的优秀的人，觉得自己完全没有拿得出手的方面。有时就觉得自己真是爱瞎折腾，明明没有几斤几两，还总喜欢跑出去"丢人现眼"。不过好在我的承受能力比较强，相信自己总会变得更好，而且真的就在越来越好。

	正在写呢突然收到那边大老板的回信，说六月份没有问题。好欣喜。。:)

	Try your best and wait for the result. 这句话可以作为我的人生格言了。努力做到最好，然后calm down，安静的等待结果。不属于我的，再情绪激动也是枉然。属于我的，真的跑不掉。
