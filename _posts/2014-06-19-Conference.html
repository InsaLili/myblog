	After two days meeting at La Rochelle, now I come back.
</p>
<p>
 	The presentation was good, I got some many congratulations. It was the first time that foreign people compliment my english accent. Now I have more confidence in speaking english. :)
</p>
<p>
	I also made some good friends, Blandine, Vinh, Lucie and Fahima. We had a little trip after the conference, mounted a beautiful tower, played on the beach, took photos, ate seafoods. It was such a great time. 
</p>
<p>
	The strike didn't bother us much. Our train wasn't cancled, it was just a little late. We had seats during all the journey.
</p>
<p>
	Only one thing made me a little unhappy: every student spoke their work in French, it was hard for me to understand. So I didn't get much in these days. Maybe in the following years, it is better for me to assist english conference.
</p>
<p>
	It's time to start the next phase of work. Make a good plan, carry out well.

	What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
