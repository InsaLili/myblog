<p>
	Hello everyone (maybe just myself), this is my first english blog.
</p>
<p>
	It is not easy to build this webpage (maybe just not easy for me). I installed the macport, xcode, git, and finally, here it goes. 
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, i still happy about this little succes. :)
</p>
<p>
	It is a little ugly now, not picture, not color. But i will improve it in the following years. 
</p>
<p>
	Ok, I will keep updating the interesting things in my research life.
</p>
<p>
	Btw, bon courage pour ma pr√©sentation la semaine prochaine!
